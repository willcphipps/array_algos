// Given var arr = [10,3,6,9,4,13]
// change all numbers 10 or higher to "Big" and change numbers 5 or smaller to "Small" and print the result 
// Predicted output: ["Big","Small",6,9,"Small","Big"]
// When you have solved this, create new values for your array and ensure it still works as expected.
